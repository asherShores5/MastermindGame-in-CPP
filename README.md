# Project - Mastermind Game in C++
This project recreates the classic game of Mastermind using the C++ programming language.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. You will need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. 

### Installing

1. Clone or download the repository onto your local machine. 

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the source code using the following command:
  **g++ -o mastermind mastermind.cpp**

4. Run the program using the following command:
  **./mastermind**


## Playing the Game

1. The program will prompt you to enter the number of peg holes and the number of possible colors.

2. You will then make guesses by entering a sequence of numbers, each representing a color.

3. The program will give you feedback on your guess by marking black and white pegs. A black peg indicates that a color is both the correct color and in the correct position. A white peg indicates that the color is correct but in the incorrect position.

4. Keep making guesses until you have either figured out the correct code or you have reached the maximum number of attempts.
